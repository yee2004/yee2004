## 💼 Experience

### 🏆 Final Year Project: Zero-Knowledge E-voting System
Developed a Zero-Knowledge E-Voting System combining cryptographic anonymity with verifiable election integrity:

* 🔒 Implemented Hashed Pseudonymity (SHA-256) and RSA-signed JWTs to mathematically guarantee voter eligibility without exposing plaintext identities.
* 💻 Built an interactive voter dashboard and admin portal, integrating WebAssembly (WASM) for lightning-fast, client-side proof generation.
* ✅ Engineered a zk-STARK verification engine (winterfell) and Deterministic Nullifiers to strictly prevent double-voting and ensure computational integrity.
* 🌐 Designed a Microservices Architecture separating the Identity Provider (IdP) from the Voting Verifier to establish a flawless zero-knowledge trust boundary.

### 🥈 Competition: China Mobile "Wutong Cup" Regional Finals
**Award:** Second Place - Digital Intelligence Innovation Competition International Region "AI+Security" Track

* Developed a 3-layer "Risk Triangle" scoring algorithm that dynamically computes user vulnerability through statistical evaluation of demographic identity, threat exposure, and interactive behaviors.
* Engineered a hybrid fraud detection engine using Python, combining a custom 7-rule deterministic system with an ensemble model (XGBoost and Isolation Forest) to identify complex telecommunications fraud patterns.
* Gained hands-on experience integrating AI and security solutions into complex enterprise systems
